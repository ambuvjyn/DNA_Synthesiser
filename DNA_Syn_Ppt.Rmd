# Slide 1: DNA Sequence Generator
### Pitch Presentation

# Slide 2: Problem Statement

## Problem Statement
- Generating DNA sequences manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
- Researchers and bioinformaticians often require quick and accurate generation of DNA sequences for their experiments.
- Existing tools may lack flexibility or are not easily accessible.


# Slide 3: Solution

## Solution: DNA Sequence Generator
- An intuitive and user-friendly web application.
- Generates DNA sequences based on user-defined parameters.
- Provides flexibility in sequence length, custom naming, and color-coding of nucleotides.
- Saves time and reduces errors in DNA sequence generation.

# Slide 4: How It Works

## How It Works
1. Adjust the sequence length using a slider.
2. Specify a custom name for the sequence.
3. Choose to enable or disable color-coding of nucleotides.
4. Click the "Generate Sequence" button.
5. The generated DNA sequence is displayed in real-time.

# Slide 4.1: How It Works

## How It Works

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Embedded R code
seq_length <- 50
sequence_name <- "MySequence"
color_coding <- TRUE

# Generate DNA sequence
dna_sequence <- paste(sample(c("A", "T", "G", "C"), seq_length, replace = TRUE), collapse = "")

# Color coding
if (color_coding) {
  dna_sequence <- gsub("A", "<span style='color:red'>A</span>", dna_sequence)
  dna_sequence <- gsub("T", "<span style='color:green'>T</span>", dna_sequence)
  dna_sequence <- gsub("G", "<span style='color:yellow'>G</span>", dna_sequence)
  dna_sequence <- gsub("C", "<span style='color:black'>C</span>", dna_sequence)
}
```

# Slide 5: Use Cases and Benefits

## Use Cases and Benefits
- Research laboratories: Streamlines experimental workflows.
- Bioinformatics analysis: Enables quick testing and validation of algorithms.
- Educational purposes: Facilitates learning and teaching of DNA sequence generation.
- Accurate and customizable results.
- Simplifies complex tasks and reduces errors.
